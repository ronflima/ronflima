# Bio

I'm a professional program writer.Since I was a kid I wanted to deal with
computers. My first contact with computers date back to 1982, when I met an
Apple II machine. At that time, I was only 11. But only in 1986 I could get
really interested in computers. My mother registered me on a BASIC course. So, I
learned BASIC on TRS-80 based machines: Prologica CP-200 and Microdigital TK-85
and TK-90X. 

But, in 1991, after six months of electrical engineering course, I learned
Pascal. At that time, electrical engineering died for me, but computing was
born. In 1994 I got my first job as a programmer: C programmer. I wrote lots of
C code, using Sybase embedded SQL. And from there, I did not stop. 

I learned several programming languages: BASIC, Pascal, C, C++, Visual Basic,
Transact SQL, PL/SQL, TCL, TK, Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Objective
C, Swift, Objective C++, Smalltalk, LISP, Bourne and C shell scripting,
Applescript, Lua, and the list keeps growing.

Along with the non-stoping list of programming languages, also comes a list of
frameworks like Flask, Django, Django Rest Framework, Rails, Apple's UIKit and
so forth.
